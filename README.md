# Copyright Note
This procedure is for scientific use only and can not be used for commercial purposes. If you are going to use the program in a paper or work, please quote the following paper.


We provide the code for open set domain adaptation algorithm, Distribution Alignment with Open Difference (DAOD).
You just need to modify the path and run in matlab (we implement our code in MATLAB R2019a).
